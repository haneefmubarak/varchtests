varchtests
==========

Various test for various things in various languages on various architectures

You are welcome to add useful one time utilities (tests) for pretty much anything useful (things) in almost any common/useful free (with a few exceptions as will be listed below) language, and it should be portable across at least one architecture. Also, you must ensure that the code is reasonably understandable to any programmer. And obviously, you must follow the license. This means that:

 - Most languages are acceptable, even assembly and/or BrainFuck
 - The utility must be useful
 - Testing on multiple archs is recommended, an output folder may be added in the future where various outputs from the programs can be given
 - All of the output must be given on the console (ie: Standard Output)
 - The utility should be used to check for something that may vary and not something stupid such as 1+1=2 (although if an error of such nature occurs on a common system, a thorough program testing for it may be allowed)
 - The code you submit should be licensed as is listed in the LICENSE file (free to use, may not be distributed along with any other software, may not be redistributed, any changes must be sent back to the repo, etc.)
 - Binary files may not be distributed
 - Code should be written in a manner where the code yields sufficient meaning to any programmer of decent skill. If this is not possible, comment as much as is necessary to bring to such a level
 - Don't worry about optimizing your code. However, if you do want to optimize some code while keeping the clarity intact, be my guest.
 
One more thing: programs **don't** have to be written in the same language as they are testing for. They simply must be written in a related language  (ie: almost all developers of that language use or have used it to do something for a program written in said language). For instance, writing a script to check for something related to C would be okay to do using the shell (it is assumed that the user is using some sort of *nix compatible environment), but it would not be okay to use Javascript to check for something related to PHP.

Also, please only commit one file at a time. Multi-file commits will likely be ignored.

Allowed Proprietary Languages
=============================

Very few proprietary languages will be allowed, and they must have sufficient justification. Add an issue if you believe that your favorite language (which happens to be proprietary ought to be allowed).
